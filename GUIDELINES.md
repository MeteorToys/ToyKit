ToyKit Acceptance Guidelines
============================

## How does approval work?
It's pretty simple: just send the package code and details to toykit@meteor.toys and I will look over it and let get back to you. Approval will be up to Meteor Toys, and any package may be declined or accepted outside these guidelines. 

## What kind of packages get approved? 
The intention here is to allow other's to create development tools and debug packages for other popular packages. My main request is that you do not replicate core functionality. Otherwise, the rest should be fine.

## Why is there an approval system?
This is the best way to ensure that packages work for everyone. If there are breaking changes in a future release, I can improvise and make sure the third-party packages continue working. Additionally, I can feature approved packages on the website for everyone to see.

## Misc 
Please note that any toy may be rejected for any reason outside of what is specified here. If you are worried that your idea may be rejected, please contact me first and I will be happy to help. Also, think of me as collaborator for your package. I can help you out with the icon design and etc.
